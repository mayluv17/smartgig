<p>Generally, cancellation is not recommended and is strongly discouraged. We recommend working out problems with your seller first. However, in the event that one of the following situations occurs, Smartgig may issue a refund (minus the order processing fee; no fee paid to the seller): Sound is not of studio or studio equivalent quality; singer’s voice is not the same quality or sound as their sample; singer’s voices do not align with the melody of the song; instruments do not align with the melody; or the song lyrics do not correspond to the sung text to the level and reasonable expectation of the buyer, then Smartgig reserves the right to cancel after the buyer submits a cancellation request. Automatic cancellation will occur after 30 days without a delivery of the buyer’s order as well. 
</p>
<p>
In the event a musician is the reason for a cancellation, including auto-cancelation, a musician may receive poor ratings and be rated as a “bad service provider.” If this happens three times in a row, Smartgig reserves the right to ban this musician from the platform permanently.
